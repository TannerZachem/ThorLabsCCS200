# ThorLabsCCS200
Collecting data from and using a thorlabs ccs200 spectrometer with python 3
## When working on my own projects I could not find any stable and simple way to interface a thorlabs ccs spectrometer. 
All this program depends on are the frameworks downloaded at [Thor Labs](https://www.thorlabs.com/software_pages/ViewSoftwarePage.cfm?Code=OSA), make sure to download the full installer, and pythonNET.
